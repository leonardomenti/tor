Tor (The Onion Router) is a free and open source software that provide
anonymous communication over the internet. It is based on the onion routing
protocol, an anonymization technique of communications in a 
telecommunications network. 

We analyzed the performance and the features of Tor
compared to the normal network connection. In this repository
you can find some scripts that performs some experiments
to get more insights about the stability of Tor, the speed
of download and about the differences in time when using Tor
versus the normal network.
